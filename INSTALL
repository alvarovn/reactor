Unpacking

Compiling
=========

reactor requires gcc as a C compiler (at least version TODO x.x.x).

reactor relies on a number of third party libraries in order to be
compiled, these are:
  * GLib a cross-platform software utility library.
  * Libevent an asynchronous file descriptor event notification software 
    library.

Once these libraries are installed, you can start compiling syslog-ng:

cd to the reactor directory, and execute the following commands:

        ./configure
        make

After the make cycle finishes, you'll get two executables in the src
directory:

   reactord            - the main daemon binary
   reactorctl          - the daemon control binary

Now do a "make install" and you are done. 

Compile time options
====================
A couple of features must be enabled in compile time using one of the
--enable-<feature> option to the configure script.

Currently the following compile time features exist:

  --enable-debug            log debug messages and compile for ease of 
                            debugging
  --enable-static-linking   compile reactor as a static binary
  --disable-dynamic-linking compile reactor against system libraries
                            dynamically, and statically against everything else
